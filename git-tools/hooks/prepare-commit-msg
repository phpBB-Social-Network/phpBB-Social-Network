# A hook to add [$branch] to the beginning of a commit message
# if certain conditions are met.
#
# This is a prepare-commit-msg hook.
#
# To install this you can either copy or symlink it to
# $GIT_DIR/hooks, example:
#
# ln -s ../../git-tools/hooks/prepare-commit-msg \\
#   .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg

# get branch name
branch="$(git symbolic-ref HEAD)"

# exit if no branch name is present
# (eg. detached HEAD)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
	exit
fi

# strip off refs/heads/
branch="$(echo "$branch" | sed "s/refs\/heads\///g")"

# add [branchname] to commit message
# * only run when normal commit is made (without -m or -F;
#   not a merge, etc.)
if [ "$2" = "" ]
then
	echo "[$branch] $(cat "$1")" > "$1"
fi
